# SONAR-BASED-ROCK-AND-MINE-CLASSIFICATION
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal data. Using the well-known Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the model is trained to differentiate between natural seabed formations and potential threats such as naval mines.

üîç Project Highlights
Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification
Preprocessing includes normalization, feature selection, and data splitting
Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
Built with a Flask backend and HTML/JavaScript frontend for real-time predictions
Includes a LaTeX-formatted report and visualizations

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Flask (for web app deployment)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for UI)
LaTeX (for documentation/report generation)

üìÅ Dataset
Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
