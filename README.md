# SONAR-BASED-ROCK-AND-MINE-CLASSIFICATION
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal data. Using the well-known Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the model is trained to differentiate between natural seabed formations and potential threats such as naval mines.
